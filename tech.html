			<h1 id="s1">What is a blockchain?</h1>
			<p>
				Blockchain is a technology that can be explained at various different levels of complexity. At a basic, technical level, a blockchain is a list of blocks of data. Hashes are unique identifiers of each block, like unique keys. Each block of data can be thought of as a problem, with the key that solves the problem being the hash. Each block contains a piece of data, a hash of the block, and the hash of the previous block, so that the blocks are linked together. This set up makes it almost impossible to hack a blockchain, because manipulating a single block will change its hash, which the following blocks reference, thereby making all following blocks invalid.

			<h1 id="s2">How does it work in practice?</h1>
			<p>
				In practice, blockchain manifests as a network of computers, each holding the same database of transactions or other type of data, referred to as a ledger. Because each computer has its own copy of the  same blockchain, which is individually updated, the system is referred to as distributed. Each computer is referred to as a node and is configured to run hashing algorithms to quickly solve block “problems”, or in other words find the unique key for a block. When someone wants to make a transaction, the information about the transaction, along with information about any other concurrent transactions, is put into a block. The computers race to find a solution using computing power, in order to earn some cryptocurrency as payment, known as a block reward. This process is called “mining.” Once a solution is found, other computers must verify it, after which the block will be considered confirmed, and added to the end of the chain. This is called the Proof of Work model of verifying transactions.

			<h1 id="s3">Why is it useful?</h1>
			<p>
				The main features that make blockchain technology so useful are it’s security, cost, and speed. Blockchain’s decentralized nature and cryptography-protected data make it extremely secure and less, although not completely, vulnerable to attacks by hackers. In addition, the use of blockchain in trading obviates the need for a middleman, as all transactions are public and verified by the network. In use, this would make transactions such as transferring money cheaper for customers and/or businesses. Similarly, the lack of a middleman in such processes makes them faster, and in some cases, almost instant. This feature could revolutionize processes such as sending money overseas, which traditionally takes multiple days. Blockchain also has many other potential use cases, ranging across all different industries such as healthcare, finance, and storage.

			<dl>
				<dt>Address</dt>
				<dd>Used to receive and send transactions on the a blockchain network. It contains a string of alphanumeric characters.</dd>
				<dt>Bitcoin</dt>
				<dd>The name of the best-known cryptocurrency, the one for which blockchain technology was invented.</dd>
				<dt>Blockchain</dt>
				<dd>A digital, decentralized ledger that keeps a record of all transactions that take place across a peer-to-peer network; enables the existence of cryptocurrency (among other things).</dd>
				<dt>Block reward</dt>
				<dd>An amount of cryptocurrency a miner receives for processing transactions in a given block.</dd>
				<dt>Blocks</dt>
				<dd>Transactions from the network fill blocks. And, as the transactions are validated, they are compiled into the blockchain permanently. Blocks include a timestamp. They’re built in such a way that they cannot be changed once recorded.</dd>
				<dt>Cryptocurrency</dt>
				<dd>A medium of exchange, such as the US dollar, but is digital and uses encryption techniques to control the creation of monetary units and to verify the transfer of funds.</dd>
				<dt>Cryptography</dt>
				<dd>Mathematics creates codes and ciphers, in order to conceal information. Used as the basis for the mathematical problems used to verify and secure transactions on the blockchain.</dd>
				<dt>Distributed Ledgers</dt>
				<dd>Distributed ledgers are a type of database that are spread across multiple sites, countries or institutions. Records are stored one after the other in a continuous ledger. Distributed ledger data can be either “permissioned” or “unpermissioned” to control who can view it.</dd>
				<dt>Double Spending</dt>
				<dd>Double-spending is the result of successfully spending some money more than once. Bitcoin is the first to implemented a solution in early 2009 which protects against double spending by verifying each transaction added to the blockchain to ensure that the inputs for the transaction had not previously already been spent.</dd>
				<dt>Mining</dt>
				<dd>The process of trying to ‘solve’ the next block. Through mining, the users secure the network and verify computation and transactions. Currently, systems including Bitcoin’s blockchain, miners are incentivized to validate transactions based of off Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol, fees, and protocol subsidies. PoW typically requires huge amounts of computer processing power. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is the upcoming, virtualized system of incentivization for validating transactions. Both of these systems provide economic guarantees and a form of consensus by bet. But, Proof-of-Stake relies more heavily on the betting concept. (See our Intermediate Glossary for more specific definitions of PoW and PoS.)</dd>
				<dt>Nodes</dt>
				<dd>A computer that possesses a copy of the blockchain and is working to maintain it. Child nodes point to parent nodes. So, nodes further “up the tree” are hashes of their respective children. Most hash trees implementations are binary, with each node under two child nodes. Though, more than two child nodes can be used under each node.</dd>
				<dt>Proof of Work</dt>
				<dd>A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be hashed, which is in itself an easy computational process, but an additional variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a block is successfully hashed, the hashing must have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof of work.</dd>
