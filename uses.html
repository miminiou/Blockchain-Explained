			<h1 id="s2">2 - Digital Identity</h1>
			<p>Cryptographic keys in the hands of individuals allow for new ownership rights and a basis to form interesting digital relationships. Due to the nature of their structure, blockchains provide an opportunity to establish a strong system for digital identity.

			Because it is not based on accounts and permissions associated with accounts, because it is a push transaction, and because ownership of private keys is ownership of the digital asset, this places a new and secure way to manage identity in the digital world that avoids exposing users to sharing too much vulnerable personal information.<br><br>Read more about blockchain and digital identity <a href="https://coindesk.com/information/what-can-a-blockchain-do">here</a>.</p>

			<h1 id="s3">3 - Online Voting</h1>
			<p>There are multiple startups paving the way for blockchain technology to realize online voting. Among the startups that followed in an attempt to build upon the Blockchain to create a secure voting system was a Virginia-based company called FollowMyVote. <q>“There is a common misconception that voting cannot be done online in a secure way. However, the introduction of blockchain technology is changing the conversation,”</q> Adam Ernest, CEO of the company said. His company creates a voting system that ensures that a vote is recorded one time (through the use of a token) for the specific candidate they want (placed into the candidate’s “wallet”) and permanently recorded on the Blockchain. Another company working on creating a platform that uses Blockchain technology to replace and/or enhance the current voting methods used today is BitCongress, which released a White Paper on its approach. The company uses the Blockchain technology with a token based system to control the voting system ensuring one person, one “unchangeable” vote. This token is called a VOTE and by using the Blockchain to permanently record each vote, it ensures that there can be no manipulation of those votes or voting twice. The company has also built in additional capabilities that allow for people to voice their opinions on various topics, enhancing the “voice of the people” approach of the app. <br><br>Read more about blockchain and online voting <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-blockchain-will-change-how-we-vote-4012008">here</a>.</p>
